      "##4072514 @!JOHN-EDWARDS-@1FOR# The story 's false , it 's completely untrue . I 've been in love with the same woman for 30-plus years , as anybody who has been around us knows . I do n't respond to these lies . I would welcome participating in a paternity test . Be happy to participate in one . I know that it 's not possible that this child could be mine . @!ELIZABETH-EDWARDS-# I have seen a picture of the baby . I have no idea . It does n't look like my children . @!ANDREW-YOUNG-@1FOR# To fake the paternity . To get a doctor to fake the DNA results . And he asked , he asked me and Sherri to steal a diaper from the baby so that he could secretly do a DNA test to find out if it was indeed his child . @!TERRY-MORAN-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) Well that is just painful to watch . That 's the John Edwards saga . That broke again this week . We 'll talk about that and the remarkable week in politics . Our \" Roundtable \" - George Will , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Welcome to all of you . Let 's begin with Massachusetts . That is the special election heard round the world , right George ? @!GEORGE-WILL-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) It was . The second most bizarre interpretation of it was that Scott Brown 's pickup truck was coded racism . Southerners drive trucks , and all southerners are racists , some thing like that . The most bizarre was the President 's in his interview with George Stephanopoulos where he indicated that it was a kind of a failure to communicate , a failure to explain this . First of all , the President has been ubiquitous arguing for this . The longer it 's been before the public , the less support there has been for it . @!COKIE-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) You 're talking about health care ? @!GEORGE-WILL-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) Health care , yes . And this really was a health care election . Tip O'Neill 's axiom that all politics is local was stood on its head up there . This was a referendum on a particular piece of legislation that is the signature legislation of the administration . And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its substance but coldly contemptuous of the process that brought it about , the serial bribery . @!COKIE-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) I think it 's much more of the process than the substances . I do n't think anybody knows what 's in the bill . But the - I think everybody is just furious with Washington . And Barack Obama rode that tide last year and , and now he 's feeling the , the waves breaking on him . The fact is , is that everything that 's happening in that beautiful building right there is making people mad . And Scott Brown was the beneficiary of that . @!TERRY-MORAN-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) So do you think George is right that the President does n't get it ? @!SAM-DONALDSON-@1-A# @(Off-camera) Well , I think the President gets it after the fact . I mean that 's always the best time to get it . Cokie 's right . I mean , remember the anchorman , the old one , I 'm mad as hell and I 'm not going to take this anymore . That 's the way the voters are in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is throw the bums out . The bums at the moment who happen to be in are the Democrats . And therefore , I do n't care what your name is or how much experience you have or do n't have or what your positions are even , you 're the other guy . @!MATTHEW-DOWD-@1-AB# @(Off-camera) What 's funny - first , I think it 's funny is , is that unlike Las Vegas , what happens in Massachusetts does n't stay in Massachusetts . And this is something that 's a wave that 's moving across the country . I think this is a signal for both political parties and members of Congress for both sides . @!COKIE-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) Right . @!MATTHEW-DOWD-@1-AB# @(Off-camera) I think what the country has been saying for the last couple of years , when the Republicans held office and the Democrats took - came in , they said , you 're lot listening to us . You 're not doing what we want . @!COKIE-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) That 's right . @!MATTHEW-DOWD-@1-AB# @(Off-camera) You 're not doing the process the way we want . Barack Obama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within a year , the Democrats lose New Jersey , they lose Virginia , and they lose the Senate race in Ted Kennedy 's seat in Massachusetts . And it was n't a Republican victory . It was a victory for an outsider that says Washington does n't get it , Republicans and Democrats , you guys do n't get it . We 're going to try something else . @!TERRY-MORAN-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) Well , the Republicans seem to think , many , that is was a Republican victory . Just as the Democrats did in 2008 . Take a look at a chart that refutes that a little bit . @GRAPHICS @GRAPHICS @!TERRY-MORAN-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) This is a chart that shows how people identify themselves . Are they liberal , moderate , or conservative ? Over the last five years , there has basically been no change . That 's the message . That this country did n't swing to the left in 2008 and it 's not swinging to the right now . @!MATTHEW-DOWD-@1-AB# @(Off-camera) Well , the fastest rising , the fastest rising group of voters in this country right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democrats suffered and Republicans have rose . @!COKIE-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) No , which is ... @!MATTHEW-DOWD-@1-AB# @(Off-camera) Independents have risen . @!COKIE-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) Which is the same way of saying a pox on both your houses . You know , we do n't like any of you guys . Republican , when you ask which party do you trust more with various issues , the Republicans do worse than the Democrats . So it 's not a Republican tide . But it is a throw the bums out tide . And that 's going to be there - I mean Sam 's right about that - and that 's going to be there as long as the economy is bad and as long as the Congress continues to act in way that people think they 're not respecting them . @!SAM-DONALDSON-@1-A# @(Off-camera) But that 's it , Cokie . It 's a tide also to get things done . Last spring , the polls said people wanted health care reform . They even wanted the public option . Did the White House then press it vigorously ? Did the President say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no , but I 'll have to do it . No , he let the cats on Capitol Hill try to herd themselves . And they took all summer and they took all fall , and they argued back and forth , and Ben Nelson got a little something for his state and people turned against the process who do n't even know what 's in the bill . @!COKIE-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) Even people in his state which is remarkable ... @!GEORGE-WILL-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) But surely , surely , the interesting poll about health care that we had when this whole process started showed that , A , this was n't a poll , this was a fact , 85% of the American people had health insurance . @!COKIE-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) Have , right . @!GEORGE-WILL-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) And according to the Kaiser poll , 95% of that very large majority were satisfied with what they had . @!COKIE-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) Happy . @!GEORGE-WILL-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) So there was no underlying discontent proportional to the change the President was trying to put through . @!SAM-DONALDSON-@1-A# @(Off-camera) But let me ... @!COKIE-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) But they lost control . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one third of that majority is on a government health program . I 'm on Medicare . @!GEORGE-WILL-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) Right . @!SAM-DONALDSON-@1-A# @(Off-camera) People who have been in the military are on a government health program . @!COKIE-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) That is - right . @!SAM-DONALDSON-@1-A# @(Off-camera) And yet , the Republicans were able the make the idea that being on a government health program is terrible . @!COKIE-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) Well that 's what I ca n't get over is how the Democrats ... @!SAM-DONALDSON-@1-A# @(Off-camera) Absurd . @!COKIE-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Voiceover) ... and the White House lost control of the message . @!MATTHEW-DOWD-@1-AB# @(Off-camera) Well , I ... @!COKIE-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) I mean that , to me , is phenomenal . After doing as well as they did in that campaign , they , they let this public - I mean nobody had ever of a public option . Suddenly , it became the holy grail . You know , it 's absurd . They should have just been out there day after day saying , 30 more million people insured and you do n't have pre-existing conditions uncovered . @!TERRY-MORAN-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? We heard David Axelrod today say the President still wants not the small plan that he seemed to suggest to George Stephanopoulos , he still want to go big . As do Pelosi and Reid and David Plouffe , the new player there . What do you think of that ? @!GEORGE-WILL-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) I think it 's madness for them to spend another three months at least on health care when the country wants them to turn to other matters . The President 's second sentence of his State of the Union speech last year said we all know that the primary question is jobs and the economy . So they spent a year on health care . And they dare not surely do that again . And their votes are simply not there for the big bill . @!MATTHEW-DOWD-@1-AB# @(Off-camera) What I think needs to happen with the White House , they 're going to have to go through what Elizabeth Kubler Ross said the stages of grief . Because they 've been in denial . And the Massachusetts election maybe woke them up out of it . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fight , they 're going to fight , they 're going to fight . He used fight 20 times . David Axelrod talking about fighting . So they 're angry . They 're going to go through a series of depression and then they 're finally going to get to acceptance which is what the American public wants is the two members - both parties to get together and solve the problem . @!COKIE-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) But they 're not going to be able to ... @!MATTHEW-DOWD-@1-AB# @(Off-camera) Which I think is what ... @!TERRY-MORAN-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) What is the likelihood of that ? @!MATTHEW-DOWD-@1-AB# @(Off-camera) Whether it 's a likelihood or it 's not , it 's what Barack Obama ran on . Barack Obama ran ... @!COKIE-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) So did George Bush , by the way . @!MATTHEW-DOWD-@1-AB# @(Off-camera) He did n't run - Hillary Clinton was the fighting president . Al Gore was the fighting candidate . Barack Obama was we 're going to unite the country and come together . @!SAM-DONALDSON-@1-A# @(Off-camera) Well David Plouffe , David Plouffe his campaign manager has been brought back to save him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ op-ed piece that he wrote today , he says , the first thing we have to do is pass this health care . How are you going to do that , David ? I mean , thank you very much . And the last thing he said was , no more bed wetting , meaning get tough . But the problem , Cokie is right - and I heard you wanting to get in there and I 'll let you in , in just a moment . If you went to Mitch McConnell now ... @!COKIE-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) We 'll see . @!SAM-DONALDSON-@1-A# @(Off-camera) If you went to Mitch McConnell and his merry band and said , okay , you win , lets agree on some things . You 've always said , for instance , pre-existing conditions , et cetera , what 's the incentive for Mitch to say yes , let me help you pass a bill that Americans really like ? Zero . @!TERRY-MORAN-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) To avoid being the party of no. @!SAM-DONALDSON-@1-A# @(Off-camera) But it 's worked for them in the short run . @!COKIE-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And they 're looking at the short run . Meaning November . @!COKIE-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) The other problem the President has is the way , as Matt says , the anger is now focusing on the banks , and boy , do I get that . I mean , I spend a lot of time being furious with the bonuses and the way these people live and all of that . But , it is , it 's having a detrimental impact on Wall Street . And , you know , if you get to a point where you see Wall Street dropping 4% as it did last week in the wake of conversations about financial reform . @!SAM-DONALDSON-@1-A# @(Off-camera) And Ben Bernanke. @!COKIE-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) And talk of Ben Bernanke not been reappointed , that becomes a real problem for them . Because if they take this big sort of populist stand and it , and it hurts the economy rather than help it , then they 're really up a creek . @!TERRY-MORAN-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) Well , let 's look ahead to this week . The President gets a chance to restart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union address . Presidents love to come before the country and say , the State of the Union is great . it 's fantastic . Sometimes they ca n't , however . Take a look . @!SAM-DONALDSON-@1-A# @(Voiceover) Gerry Ford . @GRAPHICS @!RONALD-REAGAN-@1FO# In the near future , the State of the Union , and the economy will be better , much better . If we summon the strength to continue on the course that we 've chartered . @!BILL-CLINTON-@1FOR# What is the state of our union ? It is growing stronger . But it must be stronger still . @!TERRY-MORAN-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) So sometimes they got to find a way to say things are n't so great . What should Barack Obama do ? @!SAM-DONALDSON-@1-A# @(Off-camera) Only Gerry Ford went before Congress and said the state of the union is bad . @!COKIE-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) Right . @!TERRY-MORAN-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) And then he lost the election . @!COKIE-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) Right , there you go . @!TERRY-MORAN-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) But , but , seriously , what should Barack Obama do when he gets before the Congress and the country on Wednesday ? @!MATTHEW-DOWD-@1-AB# @(Off-camera) Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do a combination of things . He has to basically say he understands people 's fears and concerns , and anxieties and give a voice to those fears and concerns and anxieties again . But also point a path to the promised land and hope and how we 're going to get there . People want to be understood in their anxieties but they also want a sense of hopeful and optimistic . And I also think , instead of going up there and pointing his finger at Republicans ... @!COKIE-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) Right , he needs to ... @!MATTHEW-DOWD-@1-AB# @(Off-camera) He 's going to have to say I embrace this . We went off a bit over the course of the last year . But I want to bring a bipartisan solution to America . @!COKIE-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) He needs to call on them . You know , call them to action and ask them to be in it together for the country and , you know , so that they look unpatriotic if they 're not . @!SAM-DONALDSON-@1-A# @(Off-camera) Well here 's where I differ with you . I think to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says bed wetting , he 's talking about Harry Truman . He 's talking about Franklin Delano Roosevelt , and to some extent , Ronald Reagan . I think the President has to make it clear and I do n't mean by name calling , that he is now going to lead and he is going to set an agenda which he believes is good for the American public and he wants their cooperation . But he 's going to try and get it done . If he just says , let me come - bring me your plans . When he threw the public option under the bus last September by saying , I 'm for it , yet if you have other ideas , bring it to me , you knew it was dead . He needs to be very affirmative I think , about saying this is what the country needs . And I 'm going to lead to get it . @!TERRY-MORAN-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) But does n't he need to get distance between himself and congressional Democrats ? @!GEORGE-WILL-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) Yes . Of course . @!TERRY-MORAN-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people thought he was something else . And now he looks like basically Nancy Pelosi , Harry Reid and Barack Obama are the same person . @!GEORGE-WILL-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) Approval of Congress among Republicans is 17% . Approval among Independents is 14% . So that , that 's what he 's really lost . I do n't think the country is angry so much today as it is sober and frightened . And it 's frightened by the deficits . The sense that there 's no plausible economic assumption that will make this turn out well . So I expect the President on Wednesday night will come in with a plan , and it will be bogus and rejected , to have a commission that will recommend difficult choices on entitlements and taxes and all the rest . @!COKIE-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) We 've had those before . @!GEORGE-WILL-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) We have . What the , what the - what some people want up there is the equivalent of the base closing commission . When the Cold War ended they had to close 300 and some bases . No one could do it politically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or down vote . No amendments . That wo n't happen . @!COKIE-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) But that , that 's the only one that 's worked is the base closing commission . @!GEORGE-WILL-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) That 's right . @!COKIE-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) And the Social Security commission in 1982 , because there was a crisis looming . We 've had since then Social Security commissions , we 've had Medicare commissions , we 've had budget commissions . And they 've all just sort of fizzled out because ... @!SAM-DONALDSON-@1-A# @(Off-camera) I agree . @!COKIE-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) ... nobody had the political will to do what the commission said . @!SAM-DONALDSON-@1-A# @(Off-camera) He has - he 's the President . He has to be the leader . Now he may go down again . But he has got to say , here 's my plan . You 're right , he has to herd the Democrats , first of all . @!COKIE-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) But I also do n't think that they 're so upset about the deficit ... @!MATTHEW-DOWD-@1-AB# @(Off-camera) Well actually I do n't - actually I ... @!COKIE-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) I think they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think the best thing to do , for him to do is get in a fight with the Democrats . Right away , get in a fight with the Democrats . Because the Democrats right now , are as less liked as the Republicans are in Congress . So if he demonstrates , listen , I got elected because I was going to be a post partisan president . That 's why I got elected . I was going to bring the country together . I was going to stop the dysfunction up the street . I was going to stop that . And the dysfunction belongs in both political parties . And I 'm going to take on the Democrats on something big and get it done and work with the Republicans to do it . I think that 's what the country wants . @!SAM-DONALDSON-@1-A# @(Off-camera) Clinton , Clinton signed the reform bill . @!COKIE-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) Right . @!SAM-DONALDSON-@1-A# @(Off-camera) And Mario Cuomo and all the good Democratic liberals said that 's the end of the country almost . And of course it was n't . He has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could do it is education . And he does have a very interesting education proposal that 's running into problems with Democrats . @!TERRY-MORAN-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) Let 's , let 's go across the street from the Congress for a moment . There was an historic decision this week out of the Supreme Court of the United States on the First Amendment . The court holding that the campaign finance reform prohibition on corporations and unions using money from the general funds to support or oppose candidates , that 's a violation of free speech . So is this a vindication of the First Amendment or is this a surrender to the plutocracy ? @!GEORGE-WILL-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) Vindication . Because the court recognized the obvious which is that you can not disseminate political speech without money . And therefore to restrict money is to restrict the dissemination of speech . To that end , they have freed up the amount of money that will be spent . Now some people say oh corporations , that means Microsoft will be buying ads . Microsoft is trying to sell software . They 're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emancipates are nonprofit advocacy corporations such as the Sierra Club . I pick that not at random because Sierra Club was fined $28,000 in Florida last year for falling afoul of the incomprehensible that thick set of regulations on our political speech . @!SAM-DONALDSON-@1-A# @(Off-camera) Poor Sierra Club . But how about Goldman Sachs ? I agree , in this case , with Mr Bumble , of Dickens fame , the law is an ass . An idiot . Here 's what the Supreme Court has said . Let 's take Mr Blankfein , who is in charge of Goldman Sachs . He can only give $2400 of his own money to - directly to a candidate . But now Goldman Sachs can give millions directly . What if they do n't like ... @!TERRY-MORAN-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) Not give to the candidate , they can give to spend for ads in favor of the candidate . @!SAM-DONALDSON-@1-A# @(Off-camera) Yes , exactly . That 's right . But they can spend it and say , this man , Barney Frank , has gone too far in trying to restrict us , let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't give but $2400 . Now what sense does that make ? To say that a corporation , a legal entity has freedom of speech to give all this money but I do n't ? @!COKIE-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) Well it 's not like - it 's not like we 're looking for money in politics . It 's not like that , you know , we , we 're just starving for cash . You know , the politics is awash in money . And that is really one of the biggest problems . One of the reasons we 've had the kind of stalemates that we 've had on Capitol Hill and the reasons that people are doing things that voters do n't like very much is because they 're spending so much of their time out fund-raising , all the time dealing with funders and not necessarily the American public . @!SAM-DONALDSON-@1-A# @(Off-camera) Yeah , but the money needs to be - have some equality here . @!MATTHEW-DOWD-@1-AB# @(Off-camera) I do n't know the - I do n't know , obviously , the constitutional law part . The practical application @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and labor unions are n't influencing the process . Do they have a First Amendment right to like influence it more directly ? Yeah , I think somebody could make that argument . But they are influencing the process . They hire lobbyists . They hire public affairs firm . They contribute to candidates . They do all that kind of stuff . I think what this is , is more of an incumbency protection act . Corporations and most large entities will side , as they usually do , with the incumbent . Because that 's where they think their bread is buttered . @!TERRY-MORAN-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) And here 's the concern , George , let me just challenge - because you 're the advocate on this . The concern is not just in elections , but when they take votes . They 're going to take a vote . And they 're going to now that if they vote the wrong way , Wall Street can spend against them , the insurance industry can spend against them directly right up until the day of the election . @!GEORGE-WILL-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contributions as opposed to the convictions of the legislator and of his constituents determine how someone votes . Cokie says we 're awash in money . All federal elections last year , $5 billion , Congress up to the President , exactly , almost exactly what the country spends on tortilla chips . This is not - we are not awash in money . This is a rich country . Second , what Matt said is exactly right . The Democrats are the ones who are proffering right now . The President came out and said this is big oil and big gas . No , it 's lawyers are the biggest contributors and 83% of their money today is going to Democrats . @!TERRY-MORAN-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) All right , let 's just - we 'll leave that there . Have to get to the political melodrama of the week , John Edwards . It is painful to watch . Will this story never end ? @!COKIE-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) I think it kind of ended . With any luck it 's ended . I mean , have you ever seen anything so sleazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is so despicable . You know , there he is , lying , lying , lying , lying , lying . And , and , before the lie , there was the act . And , you know , there 's his wife . It 's just , it 's so awful I do n't even know where to begin and end with it . @!SAM-DONALDSON-@1-A# @(Off-camera) Well could I just begin by saying I 'm against adultery ? One time many years ago , I said , well , you know , compared to murder - and I thought I could n't go home . But having said that , as a political reporter - oh , what a tangled web we weave , when first we practice to deceive . Edwards , as young as he was in Washington , should have understood the Washington rule . The rule in life is , if something goes wrong , confess immediately . Throw it all on the table . Throw yourself on the mercy of the court of public opinion . Instead , he lies for two years in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm a new man . @!MATTHEW-DOWD-@1-AB# @(Off-camera) Well , I - you know to me it 's - first of all , on a personal thing , I have tremendous sympathy and compassion for Elizabeth Edwards . And I know she 's taking some heat in a new book , \" Game Change \" where there 's certain things . But this is a woman that was involved in a relationship that became actually a total lie and she 's had to deal with it . So tremendous compassion . @!COKIE-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) Also I think it 's always horrible ... @!MATTHEW-DOWD-@1-AB# @(Off-camera) But I think , more globally about this , the ability for people today to compartmentalize their lives . Tiger Woods is a disciplined guy on the golf course . @!COKIE-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) No , for men to compartmentalize their lives . @!SAM-DONALDSON-@1-A# @(Off-camera) Wait a moment . @!COKIE-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) This is not something that women do . @!TERRY-MORAN-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) The last word here and it 's a good one .

If you \\'re not a football fan at all , let \\'s pretend , but you do like to watch because it \\'s the big hoopla , there are two things I know everyone watched and it was the National Anthems that were ... @!GIFFORD: Oh , yes . Oh , yes . @!KOTB: ... sung before each game . Now one person -- it was Steven Tyler and Kristin Chenoweth . Steven Tyler sparked a lot of controversy . @!GIFFORD: Are there two people more different ? More disalike than -- is that a -- is that a word ? @!KOTB: That , too . @!GIFFORD: Yeah . Yeah . @!KOTB: All right . So let \\'s watch Steven Tyler as he sang the National Anthem , please . @!GIFFORD: Study in contrasts . @(Clip-of-Steven-Tyl @!KOTB: Now he got knocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He -- that \\'s how he sings . @!KOTB: But -- that \\'s -- yes , that \\'s -- if you hire Steven Tyler , that \\'s who you get . @!GIFFORD: You ai n\\'t going to get Michael Buble. @!KOTB: Yeah . @!GIFFORD: You know ? @!KOTB: Right . @!GIFFORD: Plus , he \\'s Canadian so he probably would n\\'t sing it anyway . But you know , that \\'s what you \\'re going to get . @!KOTB: Yes , I agree . @!GIFFORD: He \\'s known for ... @(screams) . @!KOTB: And Kristin Chenoweth was the complete opposite . @!GIFFORD: How adorable is she ? @!KOTB: Beautiful . In this pouring rain she sung beautifully . She was before the 49ers-Giants game . @!GIFFORD: Yeah . She \\'s an old Broadway trouper , the show must go on eight shows a week , and she was awesome . @!KOTB: She nailed it . She nailed it . @!GIFFORD: She nailed it , yeah . @!KOTB: Did n\\'t you -- would n\\'t you have died , though , if you were the kicker ... @!GIFFORD: The kicker. @!KOTB: ... for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kid . And he had -- he was 16 for 16 up till that point . @!KOTB: So if you watched the game ... @!GIFFORD: Oh , it just -- nobody could believe it . @!KOTB: ... there was 10 -- 15 seconds left and all they had to do was hit that so that they could go into overtime and ... @!GIFFORD: And he was n\\'t very far ... @!KOTB: ... and it did n\\'t happen . @!GIFFORD: I know . I ... @!KOTB: You know what ... @!GIFFORD: And it was n\\'t a bad snap , it was n\\'t ... @!KOTB: Oh , oh , oh . @!GIFFORD: ... it was -- it was just ... @!KOTB: Oh . @!GIFFORD: You know , I -- and they had to , of course , fly back to Baltimore . @!KOTB: Yeah . @!GIFFORD: And it \\'s a long way from San Francisco to Baltimore , you know ? @!KOTB: Yeah . @!GIFFORD: And they get -- usually get on a plane right after the game , and I said to Frank , I said , \\' What \\'s it like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when you get on the plane and you go back and you -- you \\'re the one that basically cost the game ? \\' @!KOTB: Yeah . What \\'d he say ? @!GIFFORD: And I said , \\' Are the guys great , honey ? Do they just come up to you and go , \" You know what \" \\' ... @!KOTB: Yeah . @!GIFFORD: ... \\' \" it was me that time \" or \\' ... @!KOTB: Before . @!GIFFORD: ... \\' \" you know what , you did \" \\' -- he goes , \\' No , it \\'s pretty -- it \\'s pretty lonely . So -- pretty darn lonely the whole way . @!KOTB: It was ... @!GIFFORD: By the way ... @!KOTB: What ? @!GIFFORD: ... you were n\\'t here last Thursday when ... @!KOTB: I ... @!GIFFORD: ... when my mother and Regis -- when all pandemonium -- I want to thank Trudie Styler for being so sweet when we -- when my mother pressed the wrong button and we went someplace in this building I \\'ve never been to in my life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she looking ? @!KOTB: OK . First of all , there \\'s been such feedback about this show , and this is an understatement , but the part that got the most feedback of all was a game show that took place . @!GIFFORD: Yes . @!KOTB: And we \\'re trying to figure out who knew more about you , whether it was your mother or Regis. @!GIFFORD: Who knew me better , right . @!KOTB: We have to see this clip because I have to see it . @!GIFFORD: Yeah , Hoda has n\\'t seen it yet . @(Clip-from-previous @!GIFFORD: Finish this lyric to my song . Let \\'s hear it , please . ( Clip from \" Everyone Has a Story \" ) What \\'s the next line ? @!Mr-REGIS-PHILBIN: \\' Everyone does n\\'t care . What is it ? What is it ? @!GIFFORD: \\' Different as night and day . \\' @!Mr-PHILBIN: Yeah . @(End-of-clip) @!GIFFORD: Oh , gosh . I had more people get in touch with me from all over the country who go , \\' I know you better than your mother and Regis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said your dentist knows you better than them . @!GIFFORD: My dentist knows me better . Listen , what we did n\\'t do because we were laughing so hard is ... @!KOTB: Yeah . @!GIFFORD: ... I forgot to -- we promised that we would say , if you ca n\\'t get enough of Regis and his beautiful wife Joy ... @!KOTB: Yeah . @!GIFFORD: ... he \\'s going to be at the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Hollywood , Florida , on February 8th. @!KOTB: He \\'s on the go . @!GIFFORD: And then they \\'re going to be March 2nd at the Seneca Niagara Casino and Hotel in Niagara Falls , so . @!KOTB: How was that , being reunited with him after all those years , was it just like ... @!GIFFORD: We just had the best time . @!KOTB: Yeah . @!GIFFORD: And he kept calling you Koda. @!KOTB: I heard . I heard . @!GIFFORD: He knows your name is -- you know the only answer he got right in that thing ? @!KOTB: What ? @!GIFFORD: He knew exactly how long you and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n\\'t think he didn\\'t. @!KOTB: Uh-huh . @!GIFFORD: Yeah , he called on Saturday to say that he had had a really , really great time . @!KOTB: And ... @!GIFFORD: And you know what , I think he did n\\'t want to hurt anybody over at ABC by being on -- by co-hosting with me ... @!KOTB: Yeah . @!GIFFORD: ... is what I finally gathered from him . I said , \\' Nobody \\'s \\' ... @!KOTB: Yeah . @!GIFFORD: ... \\' everybody would understand that , Reeg. \\' @!KOTB: Right . @!GIFFORD: So I think I talked him into hosting with us ... @!KOTB: To come back again ? @!GIFFORD: ... yeah -- one of these times , so . @!KOTB: He \\'s got to come back . What did Frank think about the game , by the way ? @!GIFFORD: Well , he \\'s still talking about how much Trudie Styler wants him . Let me get back to Trudie Styler , OK ? @!KOTB: She was hitting on him ? @!GIFFORD: She -- here \\'s the thing , I love Trudie Styler , so do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doll . @!KOTB: Sweet . @!GIFFORD: Sweetheart . @!KOTB: Yeah . @!GIFFORD: Sweetheart . She was in her adorable little yoga clothes and she did get a short shrift because we got lost in the building , and so last my husband was seen was right over by the kitchen talking to Trudie Styler . And ... @!KOTB: That \\'s Sting \\'s wife , by the way . @!GIFFORD: Sting \\'s wife ... @!KOTB: Mm-hmm . @!GIFFORD: ... by the way , OK ? Sting . And so I took my mom downstairs to go have a little piece of her birthday cake . @!KOTB: Yeah . And ? @!GIFFORD: Ticktock , where \\'s Frank ? Not for 15 more minutes . @!KOTB: Where was he ? @!GIFFORD: Finally , I was walking down the steps to go -- to go home and there \\'s Trudie with all her girlfriends and I go -- and she goes , \\' Oh , my God , your husband is so gorgeous ! I ca n\\'t believe -- he told me how old he is . My God , he \\'s gorgeous ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sting ? \\' @!KOTB: Yeah . Back off . @!GIFFORD: \\' You need my husband , too ? So anyway , Frank was a little enamored with Miss Styler , who \\'s also Mrs. Sumner , all right ? Back off , Barbie . I \\'m telling you . But you know what ? @!KOTB: What ? @!GIFFORD: When somebody else finds your guy attractive , it \\'s a bit of a turn-on , I got to tell you . The fact that Sting \\'s wife -- huh -- thinks my husband ... @!KOTB: There is ... @!GIFFORD: Yes . @!KOTB: There \\'s something about that . Someone ... @!GIFFORD: I was looking at Frank all weekend like , gosh , you are a great-looking guy . @!KOTB: It took -- it took Trudie. @!GIFFORD: It took Trudie. @!KOTB: All right . So if you guys , again , were watching the game , there \\'s a -- there was a -- they had the greatest commercials during the game , OK. @!GIFFORD: Yes , yes , yes . @!KOTB: This one is always a home run . This is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorite . This is the ... @!GIFFORD: It \\'s a new baby , though . @!KOTB: It \\'s a new baby and a new commercial about a lottery winner . Take a look . @(Clip-from-E*Trade- @!KOTB: Come on . @!GIFFORD: Oh , that \\'s not the one I thought we were going to show . @!KOTB: Oh . @!GIFFORD: There \\'s a brand-new one with the new kid . That \\'s the old kid . @!KOTB: Is n\\'t that the cutest ? @!GIFFORD: Who \\'s probably now 18 , I do n\\'t know . But yeah . @!KOTB: I love that kid . All right . By the way , there was a guy who did get really lucky with the lottery . @!GIFFORD: This is incredible . @!KOTB: This is crazy . He went in to play the Powerball , he thought , OK. @!GIFFORD: He does it every day . @!KOTB: Every day . Goes ... @!GIFFORD: Every day . Cup of coffee , plays the Powerball. @!KOTB: Right . For some reason , this time he bought the Mega Millions accidentally , OK ? @!GIFFORD: Yeah . @!KOTB: @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes up , he -- his ticket looks weird , he does n\\'t know why it \\'s not matching the numbers , whatever . The guy from the store says to him , \\' Hey , look , did you check your ticket because I think someone from our store won the thing . He checked his ticket ... @!GIFFORD: Yep . @!KOTB: ... this guy on the left , he ended up winning a lump sum of $6.8 million after taxes . The guy \\'s a veteran , he needs a kidney transplant ... @!GIFFORD: Aw . @!KOTB: ... he did n\\'t have health insurance and all that kind of stuff . Can you -- you know what ? @!GIFFORD: So he played the wrong game accidentally . Yes . @!KOTB: I like when life works out that way . @!GIFFORD: That \\'s so great . That \\'s so great . We wish him all the best . @!KOTB: Can we wish a happy birthday to a wonderful woman who \\'s in our studio ? @!GIFFORD: Yes . Yes . I \\'ve not met her yet , but everybody says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \\'s here with her posse . This is Sherry , Gail and Arlene. @!GIFFORD: She saw Joanie last week and wants to co-host. @!KOTB: Yeah . I \\'m seeing what \\'s going on . Anyway , want to wish you a very , very happy birthday . @!GIFFORD: Yes . @!KOTB: And thanks for coming to see us. @!GIFFORD: Yes .

It \\'s hard to hear . @!LILLIAN: Oh , thank you so much . @!KOTB: You \\'re welcome . Sweet . @!GIFFORD: Yes . @!KOTB: Sweet woman . @!GIFFORD: Oh , you know what I did after ... @!KOTB: What ? @!GIFFORD: ... after we hosted -- just so I could get Frank away from Trudie Styler ? @!KOTB: What ? @!GIFFORD: And someplace safe where I knew she would n\\'t be . @!KOTB: Yeah . @!GIFFORD: We went to this fantastic place right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called Discovery . And they always have great exhibits on . They \\'ve got a CSI one that \\'s pretty fascinating as well . @!KOTB: OK. @!GIFFORD: But they -- right now , if you want to have a great time in New York and you ca n\\'t get tickets to your favorite Broadway show or something ... @!KOTB: Yeah . @!GIFFORD: ... they have a whole exhibit on the Dead Sea Scrolls ... @!KOTB: Oh , you -- ah . @!GIFFORD: ... that is fantastic . @!KOTB: Yeah , you talked about that . @!GIFFORD: Just fantastic . So I just want to let everybody know . That \\'s a fun place to go . @!KOTB: Excellent . All right . @!GIFFORD: All right . @!KOTB: It \\'s favorite things time , gang . @!GIFFORD: Favorite things . Oh , by the way ... @!KOTB: Oh . @!GIFFORD: ... this is a Beijing something . A -- what is it ? A blini ? @!KOTB: A Beijing bellini. @!GIFFORD: Bellini , bellini. @!KOTB: Mm. @!GIFFORD: And it \\'s got a lychee thing , it \\'s not a scallop . @!KOTB: @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was a scallop . Is it good ? @!KOTB: I do n\\'t know if you \\'ll like it , it \\'s a little bit sweet for you . Good . @!GIFFORD: A little sweet . @!KOTB: Mm . Mm . Offscreen Voice : For Chinese New Year . @!GIFFORD: Chinese New Year . Happy , happy ... @!KOTB: Happy Chinese New Year . @!GIFFORD: Oh , by the way , you \\'re a dragon . You were -- and so that \\'s good . And I \\'m ... @!KOTB: And you \\'re a snake . @!GIFFORD: Even though we \\'re just a few days -- that \\'s supposed to be very , very good in the Chinese world . @!KOTB: Apparently it is. @!GIFFORD: Yes . It \\'s my ... @!KOTB: And what \\'s great about it is truly , though , a dragon , me , and a snake ... @!GIFFORD: And a snake . Get along perfectly . @!KOTB: Yeah . @!GIFFORD: Mm-hmm . @!KOTB: We have a good thing going . @!GIFFORD: What \\'s your favorite thing , Hoda woman ? @!KOTB: All right . My favorite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other day , I went to go visit a friend who lost a member of her family , and I was -- as I was flying through I picked up this book and it \\'s called \" A Simple Act of Gratitude . \" And it \\'s about a guy whose life is caving in , his job is terrible , he \\'s losing -- he does n\\'t have any money , his kids -- everything \\'s wrong . @!GIFFORD: Right . @!KOTB: And he has never written a thank you note to anybody in his life , and he gets a thank you note from someone and it touches him . So he decides over the course of a year for 365 days he \\'s going to write a thank you note every single day to somebody . And it changes his life . @!GIFFORD: Gratitude always does . @!KOTB: He gives a thank you note to the barista at Starbucks who remembers his name , and he says , \\' Look , I just want to tell you it meant a lot that every day I walk in you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know -- is it going to be a venti ? \" And it touched that guy . And he found out that he got money , he got his health back , he got everything back slowly ... @!GIFFORD: Everything . @!KOTB: ... over -- just over the course of a year . And it seemed like an easy exercise . @!GIFFORD: It \\'s just -- it \\'s so simple and we stumble over it . @!KOTB: Yeah . @!GIFFORD: That \\'s why I love Ann \\'s book ... @!KOTB: You do . Yeah . @!GIFFORD: ... you know , \" A Thousand -- A Thousand Gifts . \" @!KOTB: That \\'s a great book . @!GIFFORD: Just fantastic . I got the sweetest note from her . @!KOTB: You did ? @!GIFFORD: Yeah . You know , that \\'s how those things go . @!KOTB: What you got ? Go . @!GIFFORD: My favorite thing is this . @!KOTB: What ? @!GIFFORD: Now this might look like a little thing , and it is a little thing , it \\'s called Doctor \\'s Brush Picks . @!KOTB: Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your local drugstore. @!KOTB: Oh , no. @!GIFFORD: But look at this . This is not a toothpick . I mean , it \\'s a toothpick on one end , but on this end it \\'s a little teeny brush . Can you see that ? @!KOTB: Yeah . @!GIFFORD: Now watch , I \\'m going to -- I \\'m going go show you how it works . @!KOTB: Do n\\'t do it . @!GIFFORD: Yes . @!KOTB: Do n\\'t do it . @!GIFFORD: And I \\'m going to -- and I \\'m going to show my other talent at the same time . Can we get a close-up , please ? @!KOTB: Oh , no . Do n\\'t -- ew . Ew ! @!GIFFORD: It goes right through the tooth . @!KOTB: Ew ! @!GIFFORD: Stop . @!KOTB: Would you get it out of there ? @!GIFFORD: And then it just -- look . @!KOTB: Can you pull it out ? @!GIFFORD: Yes , it -- yes . @!KOTB: Ew , ew , ew , ew. @!GIFFORD: No , they \\'re ... @!KOTB: Can I tell you something ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was -- wait . @!GIFFORD: Everybody wants to know how the jury duty went . Can I finish my thing ? @!KOTB: No , a woman -- a woman was flossing her teeth like this next to me in jury duty the whole time . I kept staring at her , I could n\\'t take it . It reminded me of that . @!GIFFORD: But this is like this little teeny brush , it \\'s so -- it \\'s so -- because , you know , I do n\\'t know why but my teeth are the most expensive part of my body if you know what I mean , but when I eat anything ... @!KOTB: Things get stuck . @!GIFFORD: ... it shows up in my teeth . Other people -- my daughter has huge , beautiful , natural teeth ... @!KOTB: Wait , when ... @!GIFFORD: ... nothing sticks to them . @!KOTB: Where and when do you use these ? Where and when is the appropriate time to use ... @!GIFFORD: This is as good a time as any . @!KOTB: No. @!GIFFORD: No , I think right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yeah , why not ? @!KOTB: Go on . @!GIFFORD: All right , Sara , what you got , baby ? @!SARA-HAINES-report: Hoda , I thought of that exactly , you just told me the flossing story . @!KOTB: Ew. @!HAINES: This is like your worst nightmare right now . @!KOTB: Mm-hmm . What you got ? @!HAINES: OK . This is my Reebok shapewear double-layer tank and I \\'m obsessed with it because underneath here , which I was just showing Hoda , is another layer that does shapewear , so you know when you have that excuse like , \\' I feel fat , I \\'m not going to the gym , well , now you have no excuse . @!KOTB: Yeah . It \\'s like Spanx in your -- get that -- ew. @!HAINES: Because this whole thing tucks you in so you already look like you worked out before you even start . It \\'s about -- it \\'s a little pricey , it \\'s about $50 , but I \\'ve already worn this probably 50 times . @!KOTB: Yeah . @!HAINES: So I \\'m getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real cute , Sara . @!KOTB: Billy Bob likes it . OK . So you guys , we got ... @!GIFFORD: It \\'s adorable. @!KOTB: Ew . Do you -- do you do that in restaurants ? You don\\'t. @!GIFFORD: No . No . But ... @!KOTB: You only do it on TV. @!GIFFORD: ... but I should because half the time , you know , you \\'ve been talking to somebody , \\' How are you ? You get home and one of the big ... @!KOTB: That \\'s the worst . @!GIFFORD: ... and you \\'ve got ... @!KOTB: That \\'s the worst . @!GIFFORD: ... lamb chop all through ... @!KOTB: People should tell you , people ... @!GIFFORD: You do n\\'t because ... @!KOTB: I do . @!GIFFORD: ... I come home after having lamb chops at Neary \\'s with you and I am -- every tooth ... @!KOTB: Sometimes I don\\'t. @!GIFFORD: You ... @!KOTB: Sometimes I do n\\'t . Sometimes I do n\\'t . All right . Two quick announcements , you guys . AMBUSH MAKEOVERS , we \\'re doing something special for February which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart disease , so we \\'re looking for people who \\'ve been through some kind of heart issue . @!GIFFORD: Yeah . @!KOTB: And we want to help tell your story and give you a big makeover and stuff like that . @!GIFFORD: Yes , absolutely . @!KOTB: And ... @!GIFFORD: So come on down to the plaza with your ... @!KOTB: Yeah .
